# Modeling 


This application uses an n-gram, which offers benefits of simplicity and scalability.Â  Specifically, the Katz backoff model variant, which estimates conditional probability of a word given its history in the n-gram, is the basis of the selection algorithm. With user experience in mind, this method allows for reduced app size resulting in a fairly fast runtime.
