```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

## Application Overview & Usage

The predictText app allows the user to type words/phrases, then seeks to (1) predict the next word and (2) if applicable, autocomplete an unfinished word. The app is available [here](https://herget.shinyapps.io/textprediction/).

Simplicity drives the user interface design. When a user is in the midst of typing a word, a list of *autocomplete* suggestions are generated:

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./sShot1.JPG')
```


## Application Overview & Usage, Continued

When a user completes typing a word, a list of *next word* suggestions are generated. The program is alerted to the completion of a word when a space is placed after the word.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width='100%'}
knitr::include_graphics('./sShot2.JPG')
```

## Model Design

- Model based upon N-gram-Katz Backoff Model concepts
- Corpus from which model is derived converted to lower-case, removed of URLs and special characters, stripped of excess white space and cleaned of numbers and punctuation 
- Matrices excluded from 5-grams to unigrams 
- Improved speed by excluding least-frequent occurences of all n-gram orders
- Exclude least frequent unigram and bigram to improve speed with little sacrifice to accuracy


## Predictive Algorithm Overview

- Reactively, the algorithm reads the text input and predicts the next word
- Iteratively reads from longest 5-gram to shortest 2-gram
- Predicts the longest, most frequent, n-gram
- In cases where no match is found, the algorithm selects the most-frequent single word
